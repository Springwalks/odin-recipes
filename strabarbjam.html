<h1>Strawberry Rhubarb Jam</h1>
<img src="<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>" alt="Several jars of strawberry rhubarb jam">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This jam is tart from the rhubarb and fragrantly sweet from the strawberries. Since it uses Pomona's Pectin, you can tweak the sugar content as you like it. You can also vary the proportion of rhubarb and strawberries as desired.</p>
<p>This recipe makes about 5 half-pint (250ml) Mason jars.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound (454g) strawberries, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 pound (225g) of rhubarb, chopped in 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons calcium water from Pomona's Pectin calcium powder (see instructions on box)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup to 1 cup honey, or 3/4 cup to 2 cups sugar--use less sugar if you want it tarter</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons Pomona's Pectin mixed with sweetener</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash jars and lids. To sterilize the jars, place them in your canning pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Put the lids in a small saucepan filled with water, and simmer them for 5 minutes to sterilize them, then turn the heat off and leave the lids in hot water until needed.</li>
    <li>Mash the hulled and sliced strawberries. Put the strawberries and the chopped rhubarb into a saucepan.</li>
    <li>Add calcium water to the fruit, and mix well.</li>
    <li>Measure the desired sweetener (sugar or honey) into a bowl. Mix the pectin powder into the sweetener, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring the fruit mixture to a boil. Add the mixture of pectin and sweetener and stir for 1-2 minutes until the pectin dissolves and the jam comes back to a boil. Once the jam comes back to a boil, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
    <li>Fill the jars to 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean, and put on the lids/bands. Put the jars of jam in the canning pot of boiling water. Boil for 10 minutes, adding 1 minute for every 1,000 ft above sea level. Remove the jars from water and leave cool. Before storing the jam, check the seals by removing the bands and gently lifting the jar by the lid. If the lid is attached, you can store for up to 1 year to 18 months. Store without bands.</li>
