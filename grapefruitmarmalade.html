<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This marmalade has been modified from <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/pink-ruby-grapefruit-marmalade-recipe/">David Lebovitz's grapefruit marmalade recipe on his blog</a> to use less sugar by the addition of Pomona's Pectin. The flavor is bright and tart--wonderful on sourdough with coffee or strong tea.</p>
<p>This recipe makes about 6 half-pint (250ml) Mason jars.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 to 2.5 pounds (around 1kg) grapefruits (around 4 medium grapefruit)</li>
    <li>5 cups (1.4l) water, and more to cook the grapefruit slices in step 3</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons calcium water from Pomona's Pectin calcium powder (see instructions on box)</li>
    <li>1 to 1 3/4 cups honey, or 2 to 3 1/2 cups sugar--use less sugar if you want it tarter</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons Pomona's Pectin mixed with sweetener</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash jars and lids. To sterilize the jars, place them in your canning pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Put the lids in a small saucepan filled with water, and simmer them for 5 minutes to sterilize them, then turn the heat off and leave the lids in hot water until needed.</li>
    <li>Cut the grapefruits in half and scoop out the pulp of 4 of the halves. Remove seeds and coarsely dice the pulp. Put the pulp in a bowl with any juice released while chopping. Set aside for later.</li>
    <li>Cut the remaining halves in half, and remove seeds. Using a very sharp knife, cut the grapefruit in thin slices (as thick or thin as you'll want the peel in the marmalade).</li>
    <li>Put the grapefruit slices in a non-reactive pot. Add salt and cover the grapefruit slices with water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn the heat off, and let the grapefruit slices sit in the hot water until tender and translucent. Strain the slices and discard the water.</li>
    <li>Put the drained grapefruit slices, the chopped grapefruit pulp, the 5 cups of water, and the calcium water in a pot.</li>
    <li>Add calcium water to the fruit, and mix well.</li>
    <li>Measure the desired sweetener (sugar or honey) into a bowl. Mix the pectin powder into the sweetener, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring the fruit mixture to a boil. Add the mixture of pectin and sweetener and stir for 1-2 minutes until the pectin dissolves and the jam comes back to a boil. Once the jam comes back to a boil, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
    <li>Fill the jars to 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean, and put on the lids and bands. Put the jars of marmalade in the canning pot of boiling water. Boil for 10 minutes, adding 1 minute for every 1,000 ft above sea level. Remove the jars from water and leave cool. Before storing the jam, check the seals by removing the bands and gently lifting the jar by the lid. If the lid is attached, you can store for up to 1 year to 18 months. Store without bands.</li>
