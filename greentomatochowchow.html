<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is my version of green tomato chow chow from So Easy to Preserve. The original recipe includes corn starch, which is safe in tested recipes and won't cause quality issues. I've added Pomona's Pectin instead. This relish is delicious with everything from hard-boiled eggs to roast meat. It's also wonderful on sandwiches.</p>
<p>This recipe makes about 16 half-pint (250ml) or 8 pints (500ml) Mason jars.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>9 pounds (around 4kg) green tomatoes</li>
    <li>6 pounds (around 2 1/2kg) onions</li>
    <li>1/2 pound (around 225g) hot or bell peppers</li>
    <li>1 cup salt</li>
    <li>4 cups (946ml) water</li>
    <li>4 cups (946ml) white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 additional cups (480ml) water</li>
    <li>3 tbsp coriander seeds, and several tbsp dill seeds or other pickling spices for a maximum of 1/2 cup pickling spices</li>
    <li>1.5 tbsp mustard powder</li>
    <li>1 tbsp turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1.5 to 2 pounds (675g to 900g) white sugar (reserve 1 cup for adding pectin)</li>
    <li>1.5 to 2 pounds (675g to 900g) brown sugar</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons calcium water from Pomona's Pectin calcium powder (see instructions on box)</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons Pomona's Pectin mixed with sweetener</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <h4>Day 1</h4>
    <li>Wash and slice tomatoes into 1/4-inch thick half moons or wedges. Peel onions and slice into 1/4-inch thick half moons. Place both tomatoes and onions in a large nonreactive bowl or pot. Add the 4 cups of water and the 1 cup of salt. Stir well and cover. Leave the tomatoes and onions to soak overnight.</li>
    <h4>Day 2</h4>
    <li>The next morning, drain the tomatoes and onions well.</li>
    <li>Put the spices (coriander seed and dill seed or pickling spice) in a cheesecloth bag, and tie it shut. Crush the bag contents lightly.</li>
    <li>Put the drained tomato mixture in a large non-reactive pot. Add the calcium water, the additional 2 cups of water, and the vinegar, and add the bag of spices. Bring the pot to a boil, and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the white (reserving 1/2 cup) and brown sugar, and simmer for another 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the dry mustard powder and turmeric. Use the liquid to make a paste and add it back into the tomato mixture.</li>
    <li>Cook over low heat for 1 to 2 hours, until thick.</li>
    <li>Wash jars and lids. To sterilize the jars, place them in your canning pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Put the lids in a small saucepan filled with water, and simmer them for 5 minutes to sterilize them, then turn the heat off and leave the lids in hot water until needed.</li>
    <li>Take the reserved sweetener and mix in the pectin. Add the mixture of pectin and sweetener and stir for 1-2 minutes until the pectin dissolves and the relish comes back to a boil. Once the relish comes back to a boil, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
    <li>Fill the jars to 1/2-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean, and put on the lids and bands. Put the jars of relish in the canning pot of boiling water. Boil for 10 minutes, adding 1 minute for every 1,000 ft above sea level. Remove the jars from water and leave cool. Before storing the chow chow, check the seals by removing the bands and gently lifting the jar by the lid. If the lid is attached, you can store for up to 1 year to 18 months. Store without bands.</li>
