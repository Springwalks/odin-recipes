 <h1>Jam Recipes</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project is an opportunity to practice HTML, while also recording my most-used jam, marmalade, relish, and chutney recipes. The scope of content may expand to include Christmas baking recipes at a later date because this is a great way to keep track of my best seasonal recipes!

The final output will demonstrate my grasp of HTML (and later, CSS).
